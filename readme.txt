= This plugin: =

* **Comes preconfigured**
The SEO Framework provides a suitable starting point for most websites via its AI. It also comes with over a hundred settings for you to tweak; learn how to manage this in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **Is smarter than all others**
The SEO Framework has an AI built in that listens to all that WordPress gives to automatically optimize your pages. This saves you a lot of time and makes it very easy to use.

* **Has exceptional support**
We don't outsource our support. Instead, the developer of this plugin, with extensive knowledge of hosting, SEO, WordPress, theming, and plugin development is here for you. Over a thousand inquiries have been answered personally within 72 hours in the past four years.

* **Leaves no room for errors**
We focus on quality rather than selling you useless features. This means that this plugin performs faster, is more accurate, has fewer bugs, and is more sustainable than others. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines.

* **Is cleaner than all others**
The SEO Framework is built for the small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface seamlessly integrates within WordPress, and interacting with it feels natural.

* **Improves search presence**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search, and by automatically generating titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines. It also notifies Google, Bing, Yandex, and all connected search networks automatically of your website's changes with its built-in sitemap.

* **Improves social sharing**
The SEO Framework automatically supports the Open Graph and Twitter Cards protocols, this helps your posts stand out when shared on various social networks.

* **Helps you optimize your metadata**
The SEO Framework is the only plugin that literally has pixel-perfect guidelines for Google Search. It took years of research to get this right, and this means you can manually optimize your pages without making critical mistakes.

* **Creates a beautiful overview**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They tell you how to improve when hovering over it with your mouse.

* **Is completely accessible**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any type of color-vision deficiency can distinguish these. Full keyboard-navigation support is also implemented.

* **Is always doing it right**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It also leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything for you. It also automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical URL rules, which is something many other plugins don't do.

* **Follows best-practices and beyond**
We built the plugin according to all WordPress coding guidelines. This means it neatly integrates with everything else made according to it, like bbPress and WooCommerce. This also means that the plugin is secure (there's no record of exploits) and extensible.

* **Is built with developers in mind**
We encourage other developers to add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Feel free to join in on our efforts!

* **Respects your privacy**
Unlike others, this plugin has no links that cloak your information, and it doesn't automatically share your email address with third parties. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/privacy-policy/#pluginprivacyinformation).

= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
The SEO Framework is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes excellent use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

**The SEO Framework goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains, and Multisite domain mapping.
* Stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**The SEO Framework allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**And, this plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org structured data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many homepage specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82).

= The SEO Bar =
**The SEO Framework helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

We call this the SEO Bar. Check out the screenshots below to see how it helps you!

= Hardcore caching =
The code in The SEO Framework is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**The SEO Framework supports:**

* PHP 5.4 and greater.
* WordPress 4.6 and greater.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* UTF-8 character calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility and keyboard navigation.
* Multisite setups, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both current and old themes.
* Detection of various other SEO tools to help you switch graciously.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus, and MultilingualPress.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is more than sufficient for search engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the `noindex` settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

Via structured data, like what's brought with the [Articles extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/), advanced sitemaps are no longer needed.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!
This plugin is all-inclusive, without upsells.

= Is there more? =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.
We'll try to get back to you within 72 hours. :)

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how The SEO Framework works. =

The SEO Framework is extensible. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).
It brings extensions, like Articles, that fill in the gaps with newer and better techniques.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option. This will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers which tell search engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

The SEO Framework's metadata is put into WordPress' object cache when a caching plugin is available.
Please be sure to clear your cache or adjust the plugin's caching settings if deemed necessary.

== Changelog ==

TODO: Re-minify JS files... Ugh Node.JS
TODO: Re-minify CSS files... Ugh web services
TODO: Drop IE11 support in JS? Make sure the scripts fail to load... Ugh LTS

TODO, maybe: backslashes are double-stripped from SEO settings...: \\z -> \z -> z
	TODO test if this is also the case in the SEO meta settings; definitely so for Focus??

TODO: Add a classmap for components, like a "metabox loader", "quickedit loader", and more?
	* This can affect performance negatively... but it may also speed up things greatly as we offload parsing of redundant PHP, and reduce base-framework (the_seo_framework()) files.
	* The negative effects are mitigated significantly when an opcode cacher is available, however.

TODO explain why PHP 5.5 is now required.
TODO update THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_DB_VERSION to fire PHP upgrade environmental test.

= 3.3.0 - Multiplex =

TODO Exclaim:
- Multidimensional/quantum options.
- Quick & bulk edit, blended perfectly into WordPress' interface.
- TODO More term options.
- Downgrading & Backward compatibility warnings.
- Mixed taxonomies on post type related settings.
- TODO As smart as a self-driving car: Tooltips stay between the lines. Tesla needs me.
- TODO Finally (really) translator friendly.
- New posts are indexed faster with an even smarter sitemap.

..., and, for developers, we've finally introduced a reliable JavaScript API. Documentation will follow soon (based on frequently asked requests).

**Detailed log:**

**For everyone:**

* **Added:**
	* TODO maybe: We now generate a proposed description of your content every minute on Gutenberg pages.
	* TODO maybe: We now parse shortcodes for the content dynamically, for Focus and description generation-compatibility.
	* TODO We've added more term settings, including:
		* TODO
		* TODO Redirects
		* TODO Canonical URL
	* TODO Feeds now have a "X-Robots-tag: noindex, follow" header, so Google doesn't have to guess your intent.
	* Multidimensional selection for robots-meta on posts, pages, and terms.
		* TODO We still need to fix the SEO Bar, and we'll likely move the robots setting groups to labels.
* **Changed:**
	* We now support WordPress v4.9 and later, instead of WordPress v4.6 and later.
	* We now support PHP v5.5 and later, instead of PHP v5.4 and later.
	* TODO? We switched the homepage title option name from left to right, and right to left.
		* This doesn't affect your titles, it's only semantics.
		* NOTE TO SELF: Changing this would require us to change the default options, the filters behavior, and the JS code.. is this the best route?
	* TODO set `get_logo_uploader_form()`'s flex value to true, Google allows logos of any dimension...
	* **SEO Bar:** TODO Other states are now shown when "noindex" is set, regardless.
		* TODO! Add this state! And rework it, in general...
		* However, now, when the post is redirected, you'll now only see that.
	* **Redirects:** When a post is redirected, it will no longer be included in the sitemap.
	* **Sitemap:** The sitemap post limit now counts all posts, pages, and custom post types; instead of them separately.
		* Note: Because we can't guess your intent when you set the option (or left it unchanged), we aren't updating this.
		* New users will have this setting set to 3000 posts, from 1200 previously.
	* **Sitemap:** The post query has changed.
		1. First, we find the blog and front-page ID. We add these on top of the sitemap.
		1. Then, we query all public hierarchical post types (pages). The sitemap query limit is used here, and we query-sort the items by published date, ascending.
			* TODO update the explanation in the settings pages to represent this...
		1. Then, we query all public non-hierarchical post types (posts), but no attachments, the sitemap query limit is used again, and we query-sort the items by last updated, descending.
		1. Finally, we combine the pages and posts, and go through them, each one added will count down from the query limit.
			* Note that only indexed pages will be displayed. If your sitemap query limit is set to 3000, and you've disabled 1000 pages, you may only see 2000 items (+2 for front-and blog page).
			* To depict another scenario: If you have 4000 pages indexed, and any number of posts, then you may only see 3000 pages, and no posts.
			* And another: If you have 2000 pages and 2000 posts indexed, you may only see 2000 pages, and 1000 posts.
			* Note that, since we added multidimensional selections for noindex, a post type may hog up a large portion of this query without being used.
				* We may will resolve this inconsistency in the future, as we're considering adding multiple sitemaps.
	* **Sitemap:** The blog page's priority is now `1.0`, from `0.9`. Note, however, that this feature is disabled by default and deprecated by some search engines.
	* **Sitemap:** The page and post priorities now deduce based on item's position, instead of that pages always has a priority of `0.9`.
		* They still start at 0.9.
* **Improved:**
	* **Spam control:**
		* Added more `index.php` files which prevent nasty backlinks and crawlers to index this plugin's files when `Indexes` option isn't disabled in Apache.
			* Add `Options -Indexes` to your `.htaccess` file to prevent this for all plugins that do not honor this behavior.
	* **Accessibility:**
		* The homepage settings may now reveal more information on where this data can be altered.
	* **Sitemap:**
		* The blog page (not as homepage) now chooses a better lastmod value; based on whether the blog page was edited, or a new post was recently published.
			* Before it was only when a post was most recently published.
	* **Performance:**
		* The SEO Bar now loads quicker.
		* We offloaded a large part of the admin-sided scripts to different objects, freeing up RAM and lowering plugin boot-time.
* **Removed:**
	* **DOWNGRADE COMPATIBILITY!** -- Global options.
		* When you upgrade to this version or later, you can't downgrade to v3.0.6 or lower without running into issues.
			* Downgrading to v3.1.x and v3.2.x is still supported.
			* Upgrading from v2.7.0 and higher to this version is still supported.
			* Upgrading from all the way below v2.7.0 (December 2016!) is untested and might cause issues. Double-check your settings!
	* **DOWNGRADE COMPATIBILITY!** -- Post, Page, Term meta options.
		* We added multidimensional options in the form of qubits: -1, 0, 1.
		* When you upgrade to this version, robots meta-settings for posts, pages, and terms may have a new, previously unkown value entered: `-1`.
			* This value means "override and disable the default robots-setting".
				* For example, if you set `noindex` to all tags, but set `-1` to a specific tag, the tag may be indexed.
			* Because the options were simpler before, `-1` will be treated as `1`. So, when you downgrade, this setting will yield the opposite effect.
	* TODO maybe: Remove the character counter for titles and descriptions, while keeping them for social inputs?
		* Also remove the related display-options?
		* Yes, people like the character counter, but it's really not good for SEO.
	* TODO maybe: strip the removed options on database upgrade... (this will also happen on manual save...)
* **Fixed:**
	* **Accessibility:**
		* **Global:**
			* TODO: none...
		* **Post edit:**
			* When using the Block Editor, setting changes are registered consistently again after saving the page.
		* **Settings page:**
			* When pasting a webmaster code tag in the respective settings field, no change listener was invoked, and you didn't get an ays-message when navigating from the settings page.
			* When you clear a sitemap color input field, the default color is now displayed correctly.
			* TODO When navigating away from the settings page, after changing the "category prefix" setting, the example no longer reflects the adjusted setting.
				* Really... this is such an extreme corner-case.
	* **Usability:**
		* **Settings:**
			* The global category and tag `noarchive` options now have an effect.
			* The global category and tag `noindex` options no longer set `noarchive` automatically, too.
			* The post type robots-meta and disable-seo settings now only apply to taxonomies that have all their shared post types set, instead of just the post type of the most recent post published.
	* **Nitpicking:**
		* The sitemap's XSL stylesheet no longer uses the latest post ID to determine the title generation; instead, it always adds your blogname to the right.
		* The sitemap now can't exceed the imposed 50,000 limit; unless you use custom filters.

**For translators:**

* **Changed:**
	* For the nth time: everything.
	* **Notable changes:**
		* Fewer `%s`, more markdown.
		* `home page` is now `homepage`.
		* Removed and replaced (many) instances of `this %s`.
* **Updated:**
	* Translation object; POT file.

**For developers:**

* **Improved:**
	* The class autoloader now considers folder structure automatically, based on the namespace used.
* **Option notes:**
	* **Removed:**
		* `attachment_noindex` and sanitization thereof, since 3.1 it's changed to `noindex_post_types['attachment']`.
		* `attachment_nofollow` and sanitization thereof, since 3.1 it's changed to `nofollow_post_types['attachment']`.
		* `attachment_noarchive` and sanitization thereof, since 3.1 it's changed to `noarchive_post_types['attachment']`.
		* `title_seperator`, since 3.1 it's changed to `title_separator` (note the previous typo).
* **Term meta notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* TODO `redirect`, URL string.
		* TODO `canonical`, URL string.
	* **Changed:**
		* `noindex`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* `nofollow`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* `noarchive`, it can now be set to `-1`.
* **Post meta notes:**
	* **Changed:**
		* `_genesis_noindex`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* `_genesis_nofollow`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* `_genesis_noarchive`, it can now be set to `-1`.

		* TODO `the_seo_framework_sitemap_exclude_cpt`, use the options API instead.
* **Browser notes:**
	* We've now completely abandoned support for Internet Explorer. Goodbye, old, annoying friend.
		* TODO consider "no-js versions for IE".
		* TODO clean up polyfills & fixes related to IE.
	* With our most excellent users moving to HTTP/2 and beyond, we're going to take full advantage of multiplexing by sending out more scripting files.
		* More files is good, because we can selectively send out the files; so there's less code to parse in your browser on most requests.
		* This also alleviates some strain on your server, as we don't have to blindly fill states and values for all requests every time.
		* And, most importantly, maintaining the code will be much easier; so, we can deploy faster with fewer errors.
		* Last but not least, WordPress is moving from plain HTML and PHP to JS. We need to get ourselves well prepared for this shift.
		* Affected files, both `.css` and `.js` (and their `*.min.*` equivalents):
			* DONE:
				* `tsf`, these main files are now trimmed down to the most basic of forms per dependency requirements.
					* **JS:**
						* **Before**: 27.7KB minified, 2782 SLOC
						* **After:** 15.5KB minified, (TODO TBD) 1723 SLOC
					* **CSS:**
						* **Before:** 16.0KB minified, 1006 SLOC
						* **After:** 4.0KB minfified, (TODO TBD) 425 SLOC
				* `tsfc`, these files handle the character and pixel counters.
					* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfC` and `window.tsfCL10n`.
					* **Script ID:** `tsf-c`
					* Fun fact: The proposed name was `counter.js`, but uBlock blocks this script name by default.
					* TODO make counters load in via JS only, the PHP side is useless in this.
						* Well, PHP is required to annotate the IDs... maybe hide them by default, and unhide them via JS?
				* `settings`, these files handle the SEO Settings page, mostly.
					* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfSettings` and `window.tsfSettingsL10n`.
					* **Script ID:** `tsf-settings`
				* `post`, these files handle post SEO settings pages, mostly.
					* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfPost` and `window.tsfPostL10n`.
					* **Script ID:** `tsf-post`
				* `term`, these files handle term SEO settings pages, mostly.
					* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfTerm` and `window.tsfTermL10n`.
					* **Script ID:** `tsf-term`
				* `ays` - meaning "Are you sure?", these files handle on-navigation alerts, so to prevent loss of data.
					* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfAys` and `window.tsfAysL10n`
					* **Script ID:** `tsf-ays`
			* TODO (PROPOSED):
				* `title`, this file handles title input fields.
				* `description`, this file handles description input fields.
				* `term-overview`, this file handles term overview pages.
				* `post-overview`, this file handles post overview pages.
				* `seo-bar`, this file handles the SEO Bar.
				* `quick-edit`, this file handles quick edits.
				* `sanitize`, this file handles sanitization and XSS security.
				* `ajax`, this file handles communication with the server.
			* TODO consider moving this to a relay method, which switches over all known scripts, cleaning up the code.
				* Also remove the newly introduced methods, and use a single handler method `tsf->load_script( 'tsfc', $autoload );`
				* Also silently deprecate the 3.1 methods, and forward the calls to the one above?
	* **JS notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* Object `tsfC`, including:
				* Properties:
					* `counterType`
					* `counterClasses`
				* Methods:
					* `updatePixelCounter`
					* `updateCharacterCounter`
					* `triggerCounterUpdate`
					* `resetCounterListener`
				* Related localization & attribution object: `tsfCL10n`.
			* Object `tsfSettings`:
				* Related localization & attribution object: `tsfSettingsL10n`
			* Object `tsfPost`:
				* Related localization & attribution object: `tsfPostL10n`.
			* TODO Object `tsfTerm`:
				* Related localization & attribution object: `tsfTermL10n`.
			* Object `tsfAys`:
				* Methods:
					* `reset`
					* `getChangedState`
					* `registerChange`
					* `deregisterChange`
					* `registerChangeListener`
					* `registerResetListener`
					* `registerUnloadListener`
					* `reloadDefaultListeners`
				* Related localization & attribution object: `tsfAysL10n`.
			* Global:
				* After tsfAys registers or resets its listeners, this jQuery event is triggered:
					* `$( document.body ).trigger( 'tsf-registered-ays-listeners' );`
		* **Changed:**
			* `tsfL10n.params.titleLocation` now mirrors its value with the homepage settings for the homepage.
				* This used to be a ravioli code mess, now it's a thin lasagna. Bon appetit!
			* `tsfL10n.params.defaultTitle` now appends term prefixes, when applicable.
		* **Removed:**
			* `tsf.[...]`:
				* `tsf.counterType`, use `tsfC.counterType` instead.
				* `tsf.counterClasses`, use `tsfC.counterClasses` instead.
				* `tsf._initCounters`, was marked private.
				* `tsf._initWebmastersInput`, was marked private.
				* `tsf._initCanonicalInput`, was marked private.
				* `tsf.flexTabToggle`.
				* `tsf.addNoFocusClass`.
				* `tsf.setTabsOnload`.
				* `tsf.tabToggle`.
				* `tsf._doFlexResizeListener`, was marked private.
				* `tsf.taglineToggleOnload`.
				* `tsf.confirmedReset`.
				* `tsf.setColorOnload`.
				* `tsf.onLoadUnregisterChange`
				* `tsf.attachUnsavedChangesListener`, use `tsfAys.registerListeners` instead.
				* `tsf.registerChange`, use `tsfAys.registerChange` instead.
			* `tsfL10n.[...]`:
				* `tsfL10n.i18n.inputGuidelines`, use `tsfCL10n.i18n.guidelines` instead.
				* `tsfL10n.i18n.pixelsUsed`, use `tsfCL10n.i18n.pixelsUsed` instead.
				* `tsfL10n.i18n.confirmReset`, use `tsfSettingsL10n.i18n.confirmReset` instead.
				* `tsfL10n.i18n.saveAlert`, use `tsfAysL10n.i18n.saveAlert` instead.
				* `tsfL10n.params.inputGuidelines`, use `tsfCL10n.guidelines` instead.
				* `tsfL10n.states.useTermPrefix`.
				* `tsfL10n.states.isTermEdit`.
				* `tsfL10n.states.postType`.
				* `tsfL10n.states.counterType`.
				* `tsfL10n.params.termName`.
				* `tsfL10n.params.objectTitle`.
* **Other:**
	* Updated `composer.json`, now includes developer scripts.
	* Updated `phpcs.xml`, now uses the newer, non-VIP standards.
	* Cleaned up code, removed redundant calls, finished my homework, took a hike, fed the birds.

= 3.2.4 =

In this minor update, we bring you the most advanced description generation yet. The generator is now context-sensitive, so you can expect the descriptions to be even more natural; a real time-saver!

Oh, we also [fixed some bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3130), and we've implemented some improvements in preparation for version 3.3.0.

= 3.2.3 =

This minor update fixes some old, [leftover bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3105). We've also removed the sitemap pinging options for Yandex, as they no longer allow this.

= 3.2.2 =

This minor update brings [major bug fixes](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3022). Most notoriously, the homepage settings now predict the metadata perfectly in the admin screens. Bloggers will love this update, too, because Facebook and Twitter metadata for the home blog page is now always correct.

For developers, please note that the upcoming major release (3.3.0) will introduce new taxonomical settings. Because the image-rendering integration isn't suited for this, it'll be overhauled. For more information, see [this issue](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/403).

Also, for developers, note that some API changes better suited for a major release were also brought into this minor release; these were required to fix some bugs.

= 3.2.1 =

This minor update [fixes script load-order issues](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2982) which can occur when other plugins try to interact with the new WordPress editor.

= 3.2.0 - Horizon =

*What is right to be done cannot be done too soon. - Jane Austen*

**Release date**

* December 4th, 2018

**Release highlights**

* A new editor (codename Gutenberg) will launch [in just two days](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/04/new-5-0-target-date/) with WordPress 5.0. This release makes the plugin fully compatible with it.
* Description prefixes have been removed. Descriptions aren't used a ranking factor anymore, and gaming the system by repeating the title isn't beneficial.

**Did you know?**

* We recently relaunched a plugin for The SEO Framework. [Learn more](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

**Detailed log**

Happy Holidays! [(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻┻](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2957)
