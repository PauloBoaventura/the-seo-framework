= We poured over 16,000 hours into this plugin. Here are the results: =

* **It is brilliant.**
The SEO Framework is an [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system) for SEO. It is the only solution that can intelligently generate critical SEO meta tags in any language by reading your WordPress environment. This automation saves you a considerable amount of time that could be used to write more content or focus on other tasks. It also removes the need for advanced SEO knowledge.

* **It comes preconfigured.**
With The SEO Framework, we provide an excellent starting point for your website by rationally optimizing all your pages. Naturally, you can also tweak it however you like. If you're not an SEO expert, learn what you may wish to optimize in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **It helps you optimize your metadata.**
We made the only SEO plugin that follows Google's webmaster guidelines to the letter. It took years of research and tweaking to translate this well inside your WordPress interface. Finally, you can freely optimize your pages without having to worry about making critical mistakes.

* **It creates a beautiful overview.**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They suggest you how to improve your pages as you hover over them with your mouse. For example, when your titles are unbranded or when WordPress blocks indexing. Instinctively, touch-and keyboard navigation is also supported.

* **It includes exceptional support.**
We don't outsource our support. We're here for you. Feel free to drop by [our support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription/) at any time to ask a question. More than 1400 inquiries have been answered personally, typically within 48 hours in the past five years.

* **It leaves no room for errors.**
We focus on the quality of features you need over the quantity on features you don't. This trait makes this plugin unique, faster, more accurate, nearly bug-free, and more sustainable. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines. We won't steer you into writing unnatural content or allow you to trick search engines.

* **It remains genuine and pure.**
We built The SEO Framework for small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface is entirely accessible and seamlessly integrates within your dashboard. Therefore, interacting with this plugin feels natural. It might feel dull, but your WordPress dashboard shouldn't be a billboard for our branding. We won't ever change this.

* **It improves search presence.**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search, and by automatically generating titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines. It also notifies Google, Bing, and all connected search networks automatically of your website's changes with its built-in sitemap.

* **It makes social sharing easy.**
The SEO Framework automatically supports and allows you to further tailor the Open Graph, Facebook, and Twitter Cards protocols. It helps your posts stand out when they're shared on various social networks, including Pinterest, Discord, and Whatsapp.

* **It feels more than accessible.**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any medically recognized color-vision deficiency can distinguish the guidelines set by search engines. We also implemented full keyboard-navigation and screen-reader support.

* **It protects you from mistakes.**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything SEO for you. For example, it automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical rules.

* **It follows best-practices and beyond.**
The biggest problems with WordPress plugins are security and compatibility. As part-time security researchers, we focus on making this plugin impenetrable. The SEO Framework also uses WordPress's API whenever possible, making this plugin integrate neatly with every other plugin written with that in mind.

* **It has developers at heart.**
We encourage other developers to enhance and add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Check out [our API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82), and feel free to [contribute](https://tsf.fyi/contributing)!

* **It respects your privacy.**
The SEO Framework sends us no information and does not create cookies. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/?p=1701#pluginprivacyinformation).

= Unbranded, free and for the professionals =

The SEO Framework is a uniquely white label plugin that blends seamlessly into your WordPress dashboard. This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within your WordPress interface. No ads, no nags. Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your website. Note that we output standardized development-comments distinguishing the plugin output in source code. You can remove these with our free [Incognito extension](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2301).

= Behind the screens =

The SEO Framework works on many things without notifying you, because the best software should save you precious time. Here are a few things it does behind the screens.

* It prevents canonical errors for categories, pages, subdomains, and WordPress Multisite domain mapping.
* It stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress by telling the search engine to look at the existing last page instead.
* It discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even when they don't send a 404 response.
* It automatically notifies Google and the Bing network on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.
* It discourages search engines from indexing feeds and the sitemap. This doesn't mean they won't use them, they only won't show them in their search results.
* It directs search engines from the comment pages back to the post storing those comments.

= Compatibility =

**The SEO Framework supports:**

* PHP 5.6 and higher.
* WordPress 4.9 and higher.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* UTF-8 character recognition and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color-vision deficiency accessibility.
* Better screen-reader accessibility via ARIA labels and title attributes.
* Full keyboard navigation.
* WordPress Multisite setups, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection and output of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Output of structured data via Schema.org JSON-LD scripts.
* Altering oEmbed for improved sharing on Discord.
* Detection of various other SEO tools to help you switch graciously.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus, and MultilingualPress.
* E-commerce plugins, like WooCommerce and EDD.

= Copyright legislation notice =

In a few words: The SEO Framework allows search engines to do what they've been doing for the past 20 years.

When you activate The SEO Framework on any site, you automatically grant rights to content aggregators, among which are Google, Bing, and Yandex, to obtain and use information from the site, including written work, images, audio, and video. You can control these rights via the robots-meta settings brought by this plugin. Your rights and the effectiveness of these settings are subject to the region and language of your website, and the physical or virtual origin of the platform and their potential users through which your website's information is obtained and shared. It is up to the aggregator to honor your rights and the requests brought via The SEO Framework.

If you wish to learn more, please refer to the website of the [EU commission on copyright](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/modernisation-eu-copyright-rules). These rulings may propagate its effects through regions outside the EU.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!
This plugin is all-inclusive. It's 100% freeware; not crippleware.

= Is there a premium version? =

No. We treat this plugin as a premium plugin already.

However, we do offer many free and paid extensions that help support this free plugin. We provide these via our free [Extension Manager plugin](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= I have a feature request, a question, or found a bug. =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.

We'll try to get back to you within 72 hours. Typically, we reply within a day.

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

Learn more [about contributing](https://tsf.fyi/contributing).

= What do the colors tell me? =

We use different colors to convey messages. Red is an error that you must resolve. Yellow is a non-critical warning that you may want to address. Green is good. Blue is informational and situational.

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, et al. =

Not having every single page listed is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.

If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760). It brings extensions, like [Articles](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2303), that fill in the gaps via modern and more robust means.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option for it. This will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

In the meantime, you can disable SEO for the unwanted entries via the "General SEO Settings," under "Exclusions."

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers which tell search engines how to connect and index the site. We do this via the Schema.org standard.

They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, which social sites you're connected to, and what page structure you're using. This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= I don't see the breadcrumbs! =

The SEO Framework does not provide the display of breadcrumbs. This is theme-territory. This plugin only annotates them for search engines via a JSON-LD script.

If you wish to display breadcrumbs, then your theme should provide this. Alternatively, there are [other plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/breadcrumbs/) that help you do this.

== Changelog ==

= 4.1.0 =

TODO make the exclusion options propagate to the taxonomy settings, too.
	* And remove the "duplicated" warning from the robots when found. This is tricky?

TODO Polylang subdirectory URLs have their sitemap pointing to a query argument... https://kb.theseoframework.com/kb/translation-plugin-compatibility/#polylang-caveat-1
TODO reconsider pagebuilder support for content. Not all page builders rely on shortcodes.
	* Candidates: Elementor & Beaver Builder.
TODO add grey SEO Bar color (mind the color vision deficiency support...)

TODO consider disabling post types and taxonomies without rewrite support for user that upgrade from >4.0~<4.1?
	* This saves me rather then them--I expect an influx of support requests regarding this. For them, then, nothing will change, and that might be favorable.

## For everyone
* **Added:**
	* You can now exclude taxonomies from receiving SEO optimization (yes, SEO optimization).
	* You can now set robots types for each registered taxonomy on your site, instead of just default categories and tags.
	* TODO You can now set robots settings for all taxonomies, and much less confusingly so.
	* TODO The new WordPress core sitemaps are now disabled when you enable sitemaps via TSF.
		* Or disabled per se when TSF is active? Allow users to revert this via (the same) filter?
	* TODO you can now set SEO exclusions using endpoints?
		* This can be difficult to determine with the SEO Bar. Alternatively, we set exclusions based on registered EP?
* **Improved:**
	* The description generator has gone through another generational leap:
		* It is now able to discern between punctuation types for stripping leading characters. For example, an opening bracket will no longer be stripped from the start of a sentence, but closing brackets will.
		* It now texturizes the input to see how sentences are build in any language by discerning connector and closing punctuations next to word boundaries. For example, when a closing quote is found between two words (e.g. "we're"), it'll connect those two words as one, instead of believing the apostrophe is a closing punctuation type.
		* It is now able to discern sentence structures that use colons, dashes, or other punctuation, and treats them as connecting.
		* It is now able to discern latin way or annotating questions or exclamations (¿¡qué!?), and will keep their leading punctuation intact.
		* It will now strip trailing colons, dashes, and othe
		* It will now stop counting trailing words when a connector, dash, mark, or ¡¿ are found.
		* It can now strip leading punctuation, even when no final punctuation is found.
* **Changed:**
	* The General Settings' "Post Types" tabs has been renamed to "Exclusions".
	* The SEO Settings metaboxes are now a bit wider; 740px instead of 690px.
	* We added support for post types and taxonomies that do not have rewrite capabilities.
		* We excluded them in the past because many devs don't know the difference between rewrite and public (looking at you too, Automattic). This caused a rich profusion of issues (i.e. users wasting our time with 3rd party support). With WP sitemaps coming (and including non-rewriteable post types and taxonomies), it'll be a common issue, so we can now be complacent about that and revert our rewrite exemption rule. Moreover, we now allow full control over post type and taxonomy support. So, we'll henceforth support all rewritable post types and taxonomies by default.
* **Fixed:**
	* When you disable a post type, its robots exclusion settings no longer get automatically rendered as checked by accident.
	* Settings and post-edit tabs' contents can no longer stagger when you hold an arrow key switching tabs. So, they now always behave predictably.
	* Settings tab's contents now correctly match the active tab when navigating back to the settings page (again).
* **Other:**
	* TODO We disable support for WordPress Core sitemaps that land with WP v5.5. We don't believe this addition is beneficial for TSF users, but we'll explore its integration and are open to suggestions.
		* This applies to all users, whether they enable support for TSF's sitemaps or not.
		* If you want to enable support for it, you need to TODO add this TODO filter to your site.

## For translators
* **Added:**
	* New sentences have been added.
* **Updated:**
	* TODO POT translation file.
	* As always, various sentences have been updated for clarity.
* **Improved:**
	* Removed passive voice from some sentences.

## For developers
* **Database note:** This plugin now uses TSF database version `4100`.
* **Option notes:**
	* For PHP constant `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS` (equals db index `autodescription-site-settings`):
		* `disabled_taxonomies`, array.
		* TODO `post_type_archive_settings` ? Add that to a different option holder (autoload='no') for performance?
			* Basically, we want a new metabox where users can fill these in like any other archive. It's difficult, though, since it needs to listen to post type settings found on the same page...
				* We can mitigate that issue from JS+PHP to PHP only by creating a submenu. It also eases saving to a different option.
			* We also want a dropdown field (top right LTR? top left RTL?) where users can select the PTA to edit.
* **Method notes:**
	* For object `the_seo_framework()`:
		* **Added:**
			* `get_public_taxonomies()`
			* `get_forced_supported_taxonomies()`
			* `s_disabled_taxonomies()`
			* `s_taxonomies()`
			* `get_robots_taxonomy_option_id()`
		* **Changed:**
			* `is_taxonomy_public()` now also returns public taxonomies without rewrite capabilities.
			* `get_hierarchical_post_types()` now also returns post types without rewrite capabilities.
			* `get_nonhierarchical_post_types()` now also returns post types without rewrite capabilities.
			* `trim_excerpt()`:
				1. Now texturizes the excerpt input, improving accuracy with included closing & final punctuation support.
				1. Now performs even faster queries, in most situations. (~0.2ms total (bad case) @ PHP 7.3/PCRE 11 ).
				1. Now recognizes connector and final punctuations for preliminary sentence bounding.
				1. Leading punctuation now excludes symbols, special annotations, opening brackets and quotes, and marks used in some latin languages like ¡¿.
				1. Is now able to always strip leading punctuation.
				1. It will now strip leading colon characters.
				1. It will now stop counting trailing words towards new sentences when a connector, dash, mark, or ¡¿ is found.
* **Filter notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `the_seo_framework_forced_supported_taxonomies`, used to adjust an array of forced supported taxonomies, so no settings can be adjusted for them.
		* `the_seo_framework_taxonomy_disabled`, used to overwrite taxonomy disabled state.
	* **Changed:**
		* `the_seo_framework_general_settings_tabs`'s `posttypes` entry has been renamed to `exclusions`.
* **JS notes:**
	* **Event notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* `window.tsf-post-type-support-changed`, used to test for post type change states.
			* `window.tsf-taxonomy-support-changed`, used to test for taxonomy change states. Be warned, it's tricky.
		* **Changed:**
			* `window.tsf-tooltip-reset` now debounces by 25ms, so now you can call it in a loop without worrying about impacting performance.
	* **Template notes:**
		* **Added:**
			* `wp.template( 'tsf-disabled-taxonomy-help' )` is now available on the settings page.
			* `wp.template( 'tsf-disabled-taxonomy-from-pt-help' )` is now available on the settings page.
