[Migrate](https://theseoframework.com/?p=511) | [Setup](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428) | [Improve](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2663) | [Extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/) | [API](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82) | [Privacy](https://theseoframework.com/privacy-policy/#pluginprivacyinformation)

= This plugin: =

* **Comes preconfigured**
The SEO Framework provides a suitable starting point for most websites via its AI. It also comes with over a hundred settings for you to tweak; learn how to manage this in our [Setup guide](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2428).

* **Is smarter than all others**
The SEO Framework has an AI built in that listens to all that WordPress gives to automatically optimize your pages. This saves you a lot of time and makes it very easy to use.

* **Has exceptional support**
We don't outsource our support. Instead, the developer of this plugin, with extensive knowledge of hosting, SEO, WordPress, theming, and plugin development is here for you. Over a thousand inquiries have been answered personally within 72 hours in the past four years.

* **Leaves no room for errors**
We focus on quality rather than selling you useless features. This means that this plugin performs faster, is more accurate, has fewer bugs, and is more sustainable than others. The added benefit is that your site is unlikely to get penalized by search engines.

* **Is cleaner than all others**
The SEO Framework is built for the small to large corporations and enterprises. The interface seamlessly integrates within WordPress, and interacting with it feels natural.

* **Improves search presence**
The SEO Framework ranks your website distinctively by enabling breadcrumbs for Google Search, and by automatically generating titles and descriptions according to Google's guidelines. It also notifies Google, Bing, Yandex, and all connected search networks automatically of your website's changes with its built-in sitemap.

* **Improves social sharing**
The SEO Framework automatically supports the Open Graph and Twitter Cards protocols, this helps your posts stand out when shared on various social networks.

* **Helps you optimize your metadata**
The SEO Framework is the only plugin that literally has pixel-perfect guidelines for Google Search. It took years of research to get this right, and this means you can manually optimize your pages without making critical mistakes.

* **Creates a beautiful overview**
On your post overview pages, you'll find color-coded guidelines. They tell you how to improve when hovering over it with your mouse.

* **Is completely accessible**
We handpicked our color scheme so that people with any type of color-vision deficiency can distinguish these. Full keyboard-navigation support is also implemented.

* **Is always doing it right**
The SEO Framework steers you from making significant and common SEO mistakes. It also leaves little room for you to mess up because the plugin already does everything for you. It also automatically prevents duplicated content mistakes by enforcing strict canonical URL rules, which is something many other plugins don't do.

* **Follows best-practices and beyond**
We built the plugin according to all WordPress coding guidelines. This means it neatly integrates with everything else made according to it, like bbPress and WooCommerce. This also means that the plugin is secure (there's no record of exploits) and extensible.

* **Is built with developers in mind**
We encourage other developers to add functionality to this plugin. We've done so ourselves, already, with our [extensions](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/). Feel free to join in on our efforts!

* **Respects your privacy**
Unlike others, this plugin has no links that cloak your information, and it doesn't automatically share your email address with third parties. Learn more from our strictly adhered-to [privacy policy](https://theseoframework.com/privacy-policy/#pluginprivacyinformation).

= Unbranded, Free and for the Professional =
The SEO Framework is unbranded! This means that we don't even put the name "The SEO Framework" anywhere within the WordPress interface, aside from the plugin activation page. This plugin makes excellent use of the default WordPress interface elements, like as if this plugin is part of WordPress. No ads, no nags. The small and hidden HTML comments can easily be disabled with the use of a filter or extension.

Nobody has to know about the tools you've used to create your or someone else's website. A clean interface, for everyone.

**The SEO Framework goes further, behind the screens it:**

* Prevents canonical errors with categories, pages, subdomains, and Multisite domain mapping.
* Stops SEO attacks that are caused by pagination exploits in WordPress.
* Discourages 404 pages and empty categories from being indexed, even if they don't send a 404 response.
* Automatically notifies Google, Bing, and Yandex on website updates when sitemaps are enabled.

= Generously personal =
**The SEO Framework allows you to manually set various values for each post, page, public CPT, and term.**

**And, this plugin allows you to adjust over 100 site settings, including:**

* Automated title output options; they encourage you to follow the guidelines.
* Automated description output options.
* Schema.org structured data output options.
* Various robots meta output options.
* Many homepage specific options.
* Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest social integration options.
* Google, Bing, Pinterest and Yandex webmaster verification codes.
* Sitemap integration with personalization.
* Robots.txt sitemap integration.
* Feed anti-scraper options.
* And many, many more settings.

= Openly pluggable =
The SEO Framework has been built to go further than just itself.
Take a look at the API documentation located at [The SEO Framework API Docs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=82).

= The SEO Bar =
**The SEO Framework helps you to create better content, at a glance. By showing you:**

* If the title is too long, too short, duplicated, and/or automatically generated.
* If the description is too long, too short, has too many repeated words and/or automatically generated.
* If the page is indexed, redirected, followed and/or archived, while looking at other WordPress settings.

We call this the SEO Bar. Check out the screenshots below to see how it helps you!

= Hardcore caching =
The code in The SEO Framework is highly optimized on PHP-level and uses variable, object and transient caching. This means that there's little extra page load time from this plugin, even with more meta tags used.

A caching plugin isn't even needed for this plugin as you won't notice a difference; however, it's supported wherever best suited.

= Compatibility =
**The SEO Framework supports:**

* PHP 5.6 and greater.
* WordPress 4.9 and greater.
* Internationalization through WordPress.org.
* UTF-8 character calculation and rendering, including Emoji and CJK.
* Right to Left (RTL) languages, through its interface and generation.
* Extended color vision deficiency accessibility.
* Screen reader accessibility and keyboard navigation.
* Multisite setups, this plugin is in fact built upon one.
* Detection of robots.txt and sitemap.xml files.
* Both current and old themes.
* Detection of various other SEO tools to help you switch graciously.
* Translation plugins like WPML, Polylang, WPGlobus, and MultilingualPress.
* WooCommerce, for free, in all its glory.

= An additional sitemap =
The sitemap generated with The SEO Framework is more than sufficient for search engines to find posts, pages and supported custom post types throughout your website. It also listens to the `noindex` settings on each of the items and works great with various translation plugins.

Via structured data, like what's brought with the [Articles extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/articles/), advanced sitemaps are no longer needed.

However, if you require a more expanded sitemap, feel free to activate a dedicated Sitemap plugin. The SEO Framework will automatically deactivate its Sitemap functionality when another (known) sitemap plugin is found.

= Hidden breadcrumbs =
The Breadcrumb script generated by this plugin on Posts will also make sure Google easily finds related categories which aren't included in the Sitemap of this plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is The SEO Framework free? =

Absolutely! It will stay free as well, without ads or nags!
This plugin is all-inclusive, without upsells.

= Is there more? =

For more advanced SEO options and output, we offer the free plugin [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

= I have a feature request, I've found a bug, a plugin is incompatible... =

Please visit [the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/autodescription) and kindly tell us about it.
We'll try to get back to you within 72 hours. :)

= I am a developer; how can I help? =

Any input is much appreciated, and everything will be considered.
Please visit the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework) to submit issues or even pull requests.

= I want to modify how The SEO Framework works. =

The SEO Framework is extensible. Please refer to the [API documentation](https://theseoframework.com/docs/api/).

= The sitemap doesn't contain categories, images, news, etc. is this OK? =

This is not an issue. Search engines love crawling WordPress because its structure is consistent and well known.
If a visitor can't find a page, then why would a search engine? Don't rely on your sitemap, but on your content and website's usability.

Check out our [Extension Manager](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).
It brings extensions, like Articles, that fill in the gaps with newer and better techniques.

= The sitemap contains unwanted links. =

The SEO Framework takes all publicly queryable posts, pages, and CPT and puts them in the sitemap.

If you don't want a page in the sitemap, consider enabling the `noindex` option. This will also remove the page from search engine result pages.

If the link shouldn't be in the sitemap because it's meant for structural reasons, then inform the plugin or theme author that created them.
You should tell the author to check out the "`public` and `rewrite` post type arguments." The plugin or theme author should know what that means.

= What do the application/ld+json scripts do? =

The JSON-LD scripts are search engine helpers which tell search engines how to connect and index the site.
They can tell the search engine if your site contains an internal search engine, what sites you're socially connected to and what page structure you're using.
This is also referred to as **structured data**.

= The metadata is not being updated, and I'm using a caching plugin. =

The SEO Framework's metadata is put into WordPress' object cache when a caching plugin is available.
Please be sure to clear your cache or adjust the plugin's caching settings if deemed necessary.

== Changelog ==

TODO:
	- 3.2.4: 28 files loaded on the front-end, 16.97ms boot time (with dumps, can't do without). 2.49ms meta time. With TSFEM.
	- 3.3.0: TBD 24 files loaded on the front-end, 10.49ms boot time (with dumps). 2.55ms meta time, with many more features. With TSFEM.
		- Ergo, the plugin is 16.97/10.60 = 1.62 (or 62%) faster.
	Exclaim: We made the fastest feature-rich SEO plugin "almost twice" (use different wording?) as fast.

TODO: Re-minify JS files... Ugh Node.JS
TODO: Re-minify CSS files... Ugh web services

TODO, maybe: backslashes are double-stripped from SEO settings...: \\z -> \z -> z
	TODO test if this is also the case in the SEO meta settings; definitely so for Focus??
		* This is fixed for both Meta and Term descriptions; already noted in changelog.

TODO explain why PHP 5.6 is now required.

TODO "Want to opt out of future, infrequent, admin-only, non-recurring, and non-intrusive suggestions? Add this to your wp-config file: `define( 'TSF_DISABLE_SUGGESTIONS', true );`

TODO re-affirm all changes.
TODO quality-control the deprecations.
TODO test RTL.
TODO improve plugin-upgrade-notice (bottom of readme).

= 3.3.0 - Multiplex =

TODO Exclaim:
- Multidimensional/quantum options.
- Quick & bulk edit, blended perfectly into WordPress' interface.
- Multiprocessing (cron)...
- More term options.
- Counters can now reliably parse HTML.
- Downgrading & Backward compatibility warnings.
- Mixed taxonomies on post type related settings.
- As smart as a self-driving car: Tooltips stay between the lines. Tesla needs me.
- Finally translator friendly; at least, for as far as we could conceive.
- New posts are indexed faster with an even smarter sitemap.
- The monolithic facade "the_seo_framework()" is now much lighter, as we offloaded loads of administrative functionality to other files.
- The SEO Bar now has an API. You can expect more tests, items, and adjustments via extensions. (hint: Monitor & Focus.)
- The SEO Bar now only lists items that truly affect the current status, instead of listing everything that might help to concludes a status.
	* i.e., instead of "WordPress allows indexing, but you set it to noindex, and you disabled the post type", it now says "1. You set it to noindex. 1. You disabled the post type.".
- Rewrite changes (see Rewrite notes below...)
- Performance improvmenets (in numbers)
- Why term and post meta saving methods have changed: We needed to replace these systems for a more standardized system, so we could implement bulk/quick edit more consistently.
- Completely revised JS API.

..., and, for developers, we've finally introduced a reliable JavaScript API. Documentation will follow based on frequently asked requests.

TODO replace `the_seo_framework_fetched_description_excerpt` with something that uses `$args`.

TODO reload the SEO Bar on Gutenberg save action. https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/361
TODO update wp rocket's compat file... ugh, redundant

TODO adjust the title & description guidelines when using summary instead of summary large image for Twitter?
TODO index.php stuff

TODO do something nicer with interpret_status_to_symbol()
TODO add media handler to auto-fill the input data for tooltip dynamically (tooltip-text="<img src=src style=max-width:200;max-height:200/>")

TODO transform .rtl css from simple files to a single file, like post.css' `.tsf-social-image-buttons{}`.

**Detailed log:**

**For everyone:**

* **Upgrading:**
	* Upgrading happens automatically after you update the plugin, on any page but the SEO settings page.
		* If you find yourself on the settings page during an upgrade, you'll be booted to the first available admin page.
			* If you are unable to access the settings page after updating, you may encounter a caching plugin error. Flush your site's cache and it should finalize.
		* The initiator is independent from WordPress' "updating" action callback to support updating via FTP.
	* For all users, the database version will be set to `3300`. Current users might find their options being altered.
	* **What'll change for current users?**
		1. The old sitemap endpoints are removed from the rewrite rules, and the rewrite rules are flushed for one last time at PHP shutdown.
		1. The title separator `dash` will be converted to `ndash`, because that was already the case.
		1. The cron-job-pinging option is set to enabled (default), this will improve post-saving performance.
		1. The homepage's "Meta Title Additions Location" was not in line with the global title location option. So, we rectified that. This means that left is now right, and vice versa.
			* This is a downgrade-compatibility breaking change! If you must downgrade, you must reverse this option manually.
* **Added:**
	* More term settings, including:
		* Blog name removal.
		* Open Graph title and description inputs.
		* Twitter title and description inputs.
		* Social image input.
		* 301 Redirect input.
		* Canonical URL input.
	* Google (and other search engines...) no longer have to guess your intent and possibily index these endpoints mistakenly:
		* Feeds, via a `X-Robots-Tag` header.
		* Comment pagination, via a forced `noindex` robots' meta tag.
		* robots.txt, via a `X-Robots-Tag` header.
			* Only when outputted via PHP. Web servers don't launch WordPress otherwise.
	* Bulk editing is now possible, intuitively, via WordPress' native bulk-editor!
		* You can now change the following SEO settings for all posts, pages, products, etc.:
			* Indexing
			* Link following
			* Archiving
		* Leave them as `&mdash; No Change &mdash;` to keep the value unchanged.
		* Note that we can't assert the expected value of `Default`, because no two pages are be alike.
	* Quick editing is now possible, also intuitively, via WordPress' native quick-editor!
		* You can change the following SEO settings for everything public:
			* Canonical URL
			* Indexing
			* Link following
			* Archiving
			* Redirecting
	* Multidimensional selection for robots-meta on posts, pages, and terms.
	* A new accessibility feature for the SEO Bar. You can now convert the characters to symbols to discern warnings more easily.
	* After installing The SEO Framework, users who have `update_plugins` capabilities may now see a confirmation that the plugin's set up, and that there are installation instructions available.
	* After upgrading The SEO Framework's database, users who have `update_plugins` capabilities may now see a confirmation notice that the site has been upgraded.
	* Search engine pinging for the sitemap can now be offloaded to the WordPress cron-scheduler; this feature is enabled by default.
	* The estimated plugin-boot time is added to the closing HTML comment; which adds the bulk of the page-loading time of this plugin. In this update, we decreased that time, greatly--and we're proudly showing it.
	* The term meta inputs now have the "are you sure you want to leave this page?"-listener attached.
	* Multiple social images may now be outputted. How this affects sharing depends on the social network.
	* Social images may now be obtained from your post or page's content.
	* Alt-tags are now provided with social images, which help with accessibility when sharing your page.
	* For WooCommerce, the Product Category Thumbnail is now considered for social images.
* **Changed:**
	* We now support WordPress v4.9 and later, instead of WordPress v4.6 and later.
	* We now support PHP v5.6 and later, instead of PHP v5.4 and later.
	* Backslashes (back-solidus) are no longer stripped from post and term meta. Slash away!
		* This also resolves an issue where the number of slashes are halved every time you update the post.
		* Note that the site settings doesn't support this functionality, because WordPress implements PHP 4.x compatibility on options that strip them.
	* We switched the homepage title option name from left to right, and right to left.
		* This doesn't affect your titles, it's only semantics.
	* Schema.org logos may now be of any proportion, instead of only square, and cropping them must exceed 112px squared.
	* We removed the "recommended" title separator highlighting, RSS parsers are great at rendering HTML entities, so this shouldn't be an issue.
	* We no longer automatically resize images when they're deemed to large.
		* Although this worked as intended, we highly doubt users will be uploading images over 4096x4096px, and it's a waste of resources to test each image.
		* Moreover, these resized images weren't registered with WordPress.
		* When images are found to be over 4096 pixels in width or height, they'll be discarded.
	* SEO meta generation no longer occurs when using Customizer.
	* **Term meta:**
		* When a term is disabled via the post type settings, saving it won't erase the custom SEO term meta.
			* The same behavior already applied to singular post items.
	* **Redirects:** When a post is redirected, it will no longer be included in the sitemap. So, you no longer have to fiddle with the "index" setting to get the expected result.
	* **Sitemap:**
		* The sitemap post limit now counts all posts, pages, and custom post types; instead of them separately.
			* Note: Because we can't guess your intent when you set the option (or left it unchanged), we aren't updating this.
			* New users will have this setting set to 3000 posts, from 1200 previously.
		* The post query has changed:
			1. First, we find the blog and front-page ID. We add these on top of the sitemap.
			1. Then, we query all public hierarchical post types (pages). The sitemap query limit is used here, and we query-sort the items by published date, ascending.
			1. Then, we query all public non-hierarchical post types (posts), but no attachments--the sitemap query limit is used again, and we query-sort the items by last updated, descending.
			1. Finally, we combine the pages and posts, and go through them.
				* Note that, at most, 50000 items will be displayed, or 49998 if the homepage is a blog.
		* The blog page's priority is now `1.0`, from `0.9`. Note, however, that this feature is disabled by default and deprecated by some search engines.
		* The page and post priorities now deduce based on item's position from `0.9`, instead of that pages always has a priority of `0.9`.
* **Improved:**
	* **Accessibility:**
		* The homepage settings may now reveal more information on where this data can be altered.
		* Screen-reader support has been reimplemented for the SEO Bar; it's now completely written out and accurate.
		* You can now, again, navigate to the SEO Bar with your keyboard. This was disabled previously as it messed with the browser cache due to a wrong implementation.
		* When clicking the title prefix, like "Category: " or "Private: ", the text selection now goes to the beginning, instead of the end.
			* When double-clicking on the title prefix, you'll select the first word (or piece of whitespace).
			* When triple-clicking on the title prefix, you'll select the whole input.
		* When clicking the title addition, like "- My Site", the text selection no longer just goes to the end regardless of its position, but now goes to the beginning if it's prefixed.
			* When double-clicking on the title addition, you'll now select the last word (or first, if prefixed) (or piece of whitespace).
			* When triple-clicking on the title addition, you'll select the whole input.
		* When updating the SEO settings, but when no settings have been changed, you now get a proper notification.
		* The SEO Settings update notifications now also state that caches are flushed.
		* HTML entities are now converted from your input to the examples and placeholders. Like in the Homepage SEO Settings' title-additions examples, and in the Open Graph and Twitter placeholders.
		* Various sentences have been updated to be more easily interpretable.
	* **AI Generators:**
		* **Descriptions:**
			* They now work better with RTL languages, like Arabic and Hebrew; however, due to ambiguity in language construction, it will read from top to bottom (like the web is built), instead of bottom to top (like books are).
			* It no longer slices the last sentence off; in extent, it now allows accidental full sentences.
			* The excerpt clause trimming is now at least twice (to infinitely) as fast.
			* They now work better with non-Roman languages, by using updated string length guidelines, this only works if your site-language is set to these (see the **Guidelines** (character) section below.).
			* They now account for German's extra capitalization width.
		* **Canonical URL:**
			* The automatic scheme determination now uses the "Site Address" scheme in "General Settings" to fall back on.
				* With that, we also updated the settings' documentation.
	* **Guidelines:**
		* **Titles/Descriptions:**
			* The character guidelines have been updated for these languages (_annotation: Language (language) @ adjusted/Roman_):
				* Assamese (অসমীয়া) @ 148/160
				* Austrian German (Österreichisch Deutsch) @ 158/160
				* Swiss German (Schweiz Deutsch) @ 158/160
				* German (Deutsch) @ 158/160
				* Gujarati (ગુજરાતી) @ 148/160
				* Malayalam (മലയാളം) @ 100/160
				* Japanese (日本語) @ 70/160
				* Korean (한국어) @ 82/160
				* Talim (தமிழ்) @ 120/160
				* Taiwanese Mandarin (Traditional Chinese) (繁體中文) @ 70/160
				* Hong Kong (Chinese version) (香港中文版) @ 70/160
				* Mandarin (Simplified Chinese) (简体中文) @ 70/160
			* The pixel guidelines have been updated for these languages (_annotation: Language (language) @ adjusted/Roman_):
				* Arabic (العربية) @ 760/910
				* Moroccan Arabic (العربية المغربية) @ 760/910
				* South Azerbaijani (گؤنئی آذربایجان) @ 760/910
				* Iran Farsi (فارسی) @ 760/910
				* Hazaragi (هزاره گی) @ 760/910
				* Central Kurdish (كوردی) @ 760/910
			* The pixel and character counters now parse your input as HTML, giving you a more accurate rating. For example, HTML entities are now decoded on-the-fly.
	* **Internationalization:**
		* Sites set to the Assamese, Gujarati, Malayalam, Japanese, Korean, Talim, Traditional Chinese, or Simplified Chinese languages now have adjusted character guidelines.
		* UI strings that were hard to translate in other locales have been rewritten. Yes, this takes some time to get used to.
	* **Layout:**
		* Reordered the Homepage Settings metabox tabs to be more in line with the Post Meta Settings metabox.
		* Some option headers are now better aligned to the center.
		* We now thoroughly exclaim what the sitemap is and isn't for.
		* Google+ is deceased, so we added an icon indicating that, cleared the placeholder, and removed the assumed profile redirection link.
			* We didn't remove the option, because you may practically add a link to a non-Google+ profile. We'll transform these options to an array of inputs when anything goes for Google's Knowledge Graph.
	* **Performance:**
		* The SEO Bar now loads quicker, as redundant checks have been removed.
		* We offloaded a large portion of the admin-sided PHP scripts to different objects, freeing up RAM and lowering plugin boot-time.
		* The admin helper-scripts have been optimized to execute no unnecessary paint-jobs, lowering browser-CPU usage.
		* The SEO Settings notifications no longer get dragged around your page on-load, and instead are preemptively placed. This prevents painting the whole page three times.
		* We now mostly use WordPress' built-in window-resize debounce-handler, which reduces some processing required.
		* We now default all URL escaping to check for HTTPS first, instead of HTTP. If you're not on the TLS protocol already... do it! It's free, and good for SEO.
		* We split the main JavaScript and CSS files into multiple, dedicated files. Improving performance and lowering power consumption on all pages where TSF is active.
			* **HTTP/2:** To take full advantage of this change, multiplexing support (like in HTTP/2) is advised.
			* **CSS:** This significantly lowers class and ID lookups on every page load and DOM update, which drastically lowers processing time.
			* **JS:** The main advantage of splitting these files is that if one script fails, the other may still continue. The performance should remain roughly the same; however, further optimizations have been implemented.
			* **PR:** Love using WordPress on the go? Now you can for longer! Also, lower power consumption is great for the environment, times 100,000.
	* **Sitemap:**
		* The blog page (not as homepage) now chooses a better lastmod value; based on whether the blog page was edited, or a new post was recently published.
			* Before it was only when a post was most recently published.
	* **SEO Bar:**
		1. Other states are now shown when "noindex" is set, regardless.
			* However, now, when the post is redirected, you'll now only see that.
		1. Assessments are now listed, instead of written out.
		1. Perfect screen-reader support has been implemented.
		1. When a part of the SEO Bar is red, it'll now halt and clear assessment and it'll tell you what to fix first.
			* Now, you may need to fix multiple things, but you'll be guided through what needs immediate attention until it's blue, yellow, or green.
			* TODO affirm this is the case with the robots states, and if all of these statements are 100% true?
		1. The SEO Bar may now be altered and extended by other plugins and themes.
		1. The SEO Bar is now regenerated in full when performing a quick or bulk edit.
		1. Changed the assessments:
			* **Title:**
				* Added absent title checks.
				* Added absent branding checks.
				* Added page protective state prefix checks.
				* Added term prefix checks.
				* Added a disclaimer to the title length calculation, as it's not using pixels.
				* Improved duplicated branding checks; it now asserts even if the branding has been disabled.
					* Note that this check is case sensitive, while it shouldn't necessarily be. TODO test mb_strtolower() performance (Google doesn't know, strtolower is fine?)
					* TODO use regex's built in unicode-case support to find (or loop over) duplicates?
						* What I got thus far: `(?:^.*?)(\w+)(*COMMIT)(*PRUNE)((?:[^\1\P{Z}]+)(\1)){3,}(?:.*?$)`, `(\w+)(?=(?:.+?)(\1){3,})`, etc.
						* Roman test sentence: `two one one one two two two three three three four four four five five five six six six seven seven seven eight eight eight nine nine nine`
			* **Description:**
				* Added page excerpt generation checks.
				* Added page builder state checks.
				* Added page protective state empty checks.
				* Added a disclaimer to the description length calculation, as it's not using pixels.
			* **Indexing:**
				* Added meta override checks.
				* Added literal exclaiming when WordPress overrules the SEO settings.
				* Added term multiple post type checks.
				* Added term zero post count checks.
				* Added for non-standard robots.txt file checks.
			* **Following:**
				* TODO Added indexing conflict checks
				* Added meta override checks.
				* Added literal exclaiming when WordPress overrules the SEO settings.
				* Added term multiple post type checks.
				* Added for non-standard robots.txt file checks.
			* **Archiving:**
				* Added indexing conflict checks.
				* Added meta override checks.
				* Added literal exclaiming when WordPress overrules the SEO settings.
				* Added term multiple post type checks.
				* Added for non-standard robots.txt file checks.
			* **Redirect:**
				* This test has been added to terms.
	* **Spam control:**
		* Added more `index.php` files which prevent nasty backlinks and crawlers to index this plugin's files when `Indexes` option isn't disabled in Apache.
			* Add `Options -Indexes` to your `.htaccess` file to prevent this for all plugins that do not honor this behavior.
	* **Tooltips:**
		* Their text is no longer bolded by default, so you may now see different bolding in the tooltip.
		* They now intelligently determines the position of themselves, much like a self-driving car.
		* They now intelligently makes themselves wider or slimmer based on their contents and surrounding.
		* Using Gutenberg with the Post SEO settings meta box in the sidebar, tooltips will no longer overflow.
* **Removed:**
	* **DOWNGRADE COMPATIBILITY!** -- Global options.
		* When you upgrade to this version or later, you can't downgrade to v3.0.6 or lower without running into issues.
			* Downgrading to v3.1.x and v3.2.x is still supported.
			* Upgrading from v2.7.0 and higher to this version is still supported.
			* Upgrading from all the way below v2.7.0 (December 2016!) is untested and might cause issues. Double-check your settings!
	* **DOWNGRADE COMPATIBILITY!** -- Post, Page, Term meta options.
		* We added multidimensional options in the form of qubits: -1, 0, 1.
		* When you upgrade to this version, robots meta-settings for posts, pages, and terms may have a new, previously unkown value entered: `-1`.
			* This value means "override and disable the default robots-setting".
				* For example, if you set `noindex` to all tags, but set `-1` to a specific tag, the tag may be indexed.
			* Because the options were simpler before, `-1` will be treated as `1`. So, when you downgrade, this setting will yield the opposite effect.
	* **DOWNGRADE COMPATIBILITY!** -- Homepage title options.
		* The title additions locations (left and right) are now switched.
		* This was necessary to flatten and simplify the title-API, so home-specific checks no longer need to be reversed.
	* Webkit flexbox vendor prefixes in all CSS files. All browsers that relied on these have been updated to the latest spec since.
	* Image support for breadcrumbs has been removed, search engines don't seem to use these, and documentation for it disappeared.
* **Fixed:**
	* **Accessibility:**
		* **Global:**
			* TODO: none...
			* Our input-select elements no longer overflow to the right (or left, on RTL) of your screen. Most notably, with our [Focus extension](https://theseoframework.com/extensions/focus/#overview)'s homonymous example selector.
		* **Post edit:**
			* When using the Block Editor, after saving the page, setting changes are registered consistently again to the "Are you sure you wish to leave with unsaved changes?" notification handler.
			* When you're editing the homepage via the post settings, the disabled "Remove the blog name?" option's tooltip now states it's handled elsewhere.
		* **Settings page:**
			* When pasting a webmaster code tag in the respective settings field, no change listener was invoked, and you didn't get an "Are you sure?"-message when navigating from the settings page with unchanged settings.
			* When you clear a sitemap color input field, the default color is now displayed correctly.
			* Trailing, leading, and double spaces are now trimmed from the homepage title examples.
	* **Usability:**
		* **Settings:**
			* The global category and tag `noarchive` options now have an effect.
			* The global category and tag `noindex` options no longer set `noarchive` automatically, too. Albeit, that's implied.
			* The post type robots-meta and disable-seo settings now only apply to taxonomies and terms that have all their shared post types set, instead of just the post type of the most recent post published.
				* The settings screens' contextual information reflect this change.
		* **Meta:**
			* When you re-save a pre-escaped HTML input in the title or meta-fields, they will no longer be reparsed.
				* Before: `&amp;mdash;` -> `&amp;mdash;` -> `&mdash;` -> `—`
				* Now: `&amp;mdash;` -> `&amp;mdash;` -> `&amp;mdash;` -> to infinity and beyond.
			* The dash `-` separator selection has been removed, because it was converted to `&ndash;` via WordPress' texturization.
				* All sites using this separator will be upgraded to use the `ndash` option now.
				* We couldn't leave this separator in as it was obstructing a security feature. To secure the title's output, without losing any information you put it, we relied on WordPress texturization options.
					* We could extrude that from WordPress' texturization, but that'd cause discrepancy, and, as such, it wouldn't be sustainable.
			* The post status is now correctly refreshed after using quick-edit.
			* The primary term ID is now correctly visually preassigned for posts that have been created when this plugin wasn't active.
	* **Nitpicking:**
		* The sitemap's XSL stylesheet no longer uses the latest post ID to determine the title generation; instead, it always adds your blog name to the right.
		* The sitemap now can't exceed the imposed 50,000 limit; unless you use custom filters to extend the sitemap beyond that.
		* The plugin is no longer booted again when a compatibility file is loaded.
			* This issue couldn't propagate thanks to "Just In Time" checks, but since we now emit warnings, it's been discovered.
		* If the homepage is a page, and it's private or protected, the homepage Meta Title field on the SEO Settings page now reflects that.
		* Our upgrader is fast. But, just in case, we increased the PHP execution-timeout to 300 seconds, instead of the normal 30~60 seconds.
			* This may not yield effective on every site, depending on the PHP configuration.
		* Redirects no longer occur when using the Customizer.
			* WordPress already has a protection against this by bouncing you back; but, you can now preview the page.
	* **Compatibility:**
		* We took our hands off the WordPress Rewrite system. All plugin conflicts related to this are no longer our problem--albeit, it never was our fault.
			* Now, we are able to finally implement Polylang's broken system for the sitemap. As such, all sitemaps now work with Polylang.
				* Keep in mind, however, that you may wish to enable the "Hide URL language information for default language" option to remove the base language requirement to output the main language's sitemap.
			* Thanks to [Yoast's broken and misrepresenting NGINX rules](https://kb.yoast.com/kb/xml-sitemaps-nginx/), we received too many support inquiries and negative responses as it's not interchangable; so, we made them.
		* When using Jetpack's Publicize, their Twitter Card and Open Graph tags are now outputted only when TSF's are disabled.
			* When using TSF's Open Graph tags, Jetpack's Twitter Card meta tags are removed as well. As for why, see [this issue comment](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/13146#issuecomment-516841698).
* **Not fixed:**
	* **Note:** These bugs are edge-cases that were found during "breaking sessions". The overhead required to fix these is currently too high for further consideration.
	* **Titles:**
		* When you empty your site name in the general settings (which you should never do), title examples in the settings area may fail to process correctly.
		* Some WordPress character texturizations aren't converted in the title inputs, only in the display. For example, `--` should become `&mdash;`.
			* WordPress is becoming more JavaScript powered every release, we may see compatibility forwarded in the future.
		* Back-solidi are not stripped from the autogenerated titles and descriptions.
			* Because WordPress applies PHP 4 compatibility on some settings by stripping back-solidi, and then not on others, this leads to inconsistent behavior we'd have to fix independently for each case.
			* Takeaway: Don't use backward solidi in WordPress, use `&#92;` if you must instead.
		* The "Remove the blog name?" option is not hidden when doing so globally.
			* We highly discourage using the global option to achieve this. We left this option visible to let users recognize there is since an alternative.
	* **Interface:**
		* When navigating away from the settings page, after changing the "category prefix" setting, the related example no longer reflects the adjusted setting.
	* **Terms:**
		* When all posts attached to a term have been excluded from being shown in archives, the term may be empty, and `noindex` will be set. The SEO Bar isn't aware of this, because it doesn't run such a query.
			* Making it aware may slow your admin queries down significantly. We haven't found the time to see if this can be integrated via available queries.
	* **Images:**
		* When default social images are found to be too large, they'll be discarded, and no fallbacks will be used instead.
			* Your input images must either be intentionally malformed, or the images are far too large (over 4096 pixels in width or height).
	* **Filters:**
		* When using custom meta title or meta description filters, they may not be processed for the meta input fields.
			* Fixing this requires restructuring the custom title and description methods with flags.

**For translators:**

* **Changed:**
	* For the nth time: everything.
	* **Notable changes:**
		* Fewer `%s`, more Markdown. This means that you'll see fewer fragmented sentences, but do mind the Markdown markup!
		* `home page` is now consistently `homepage`.
		* Removed and replaced (most) instances of grammatical gender-(in)sensitive pronouns which would make it impossible to translating correctly, like `this %s`, `that %s`, and `the %s`.
* **Updated:**
	* Translation object; POT file.

**For developers:**

_**Note:** Only public changes are listed; internal functionality changes are listed as global "improvements"._

* **General changes:**
	* **Improved:**
		* The class autoloader now considers folder structure automatically, based on the namespace used.
		* The script loader now discerns between posts and taxonomies, and can now prevent loading scripts when SEO is disabled for the post type or taxonomy.
		* In the debug interface, the JSON+LD scripts are now more readable.
		* The script loader now accepts and contatenates inline JS.
	* **Changed:**
		* Custom setting tabs and their content-callbacks should no longer have their output be returned, but always be printed instead.
	* **Removed:**
		* PHP 5.4 and 5.5 support. The plugin now requires PHP 5.6 and higher.
			* With that, we no longer require using `wp_parse_args()` and other backward-compatible functionality.
			* You'll also find that our API has changed. For example, we now use generators to send images.
	* **Fixed:**
		* Registering inline scripts now correctly converts `{{$rel_color}}`.
* **Option notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* Under `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_OPTIONS`:
			* `seo_bar_symbols`
				* Values: either `1` or `0`.
				* Default: `0`.
				* Location: General Settings -> Layout -> SEO Bar Settings.
				* Use: Converts SEO Bar item symbols based on their state.
		* Under `THE_SEO_FRAMEWORK_SITE_CACHE`:
			* `settings_notice`
				* Values: Any simple string.
				* Default: `''`.
				* Use: Holds the last-update action resolution state, so proper notifications can be send.
	* **Removed:**
		* `attachment_noindex` and sanitization thereof, since 3.1 it's changed to `noindex_post_types['attachment']`.
		* `attachment_nofollow` and sanitization thereof, since 3.1 it's changed to `nofollow_post_types['attachment']`.
		* `attachment_noarchive` and sanitization thereof, since 3.1 it's changed to `noarchive_post_types['attachment']`.
		* `title_seperator`, since 3.1 it's changed to `title_separator` (note the previous typo).
	* Changed: `add_option()` is no longer called every admin request, only when the options aren't registered yet.
* **Term meta notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `title_no_blog_name`, int, one or zero.
		* `redirect`, URL string.
		* `canonical`, URL string.
		* `og_title`, URL string.
		* `og_description`, URL string.
		* `tw_title`, URL string.
		* `tw_description`, URL string.
		* `social_image_url`, URL string.
		* `social_image_id`, int.
	* **Changed:**
		* `noindex`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* `nofollow`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* `noarchive`, it can now be set to `-1`.
	* **Removed:**
		* `saved_flag`, it's no longer necessary. If the term is saved with The SEO Framework enabled, the term meta will be autofilled; whether something's adjusted or not.
	* **Other:**
		* Arbitrary keys may no longer be stored. Use the new API instead.
* **Post meta notes:**
	* **Changed:**
		* `_genesis_noindex`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* `_genesis_nofollow`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* `_genesis_noarchive`, it can now be set to `-1`.
		* Throughout the plugin, the scalar input types are no longer converted to strings via `the_seo_framework()->get_custom_field()`.
	* **Other:**
		* Arbitrary keys may no longer be stored. Use the new API instead.
* **Function notes:**
	* **Removed:**
		* **These are non-API functions, and were marked private:**
			* `_activation_setup_sitemap()`
			* `_deactivation_unset_sitemap()`
* **Class notes:**

				1. Now allows updating during `WP_AJAX`, this was to protect against bulk-and quick-edit; which we now handle.
			* `_update_term_meta()`
				1. Renamed from `update_term_meta`
				1. noindex, nofollow, noarchive are now converted to qubits.

				1. Now uses the current term meta to set new values.
				1. No longer deletes meta from abstracting plugins on save when they're deactivated.
				1. Now allows updating during `WP_AJAX`, this was to protect against bulk-and quick-edit; which we now handle.
			* `get_term_meta()`
				1. Removed deprecated filter `the_seo_framework_get_term_meta`.
				1. Now fills in defaults if older term meta isn't set.
			* `get_term_meta_defaults()` now returns more values.
			* `is_single_admin()` now uses `is_singular_admin()` to check for the correct base; so categories and tags no longer falsely return `true`.
			* `get_generated_single_term_title()` no longer redundantly tests the query, but now only uses the term input or queried object.
			* `is_taxonomy_disabled()` now only returns true if all post types in the taxonomy are disabled, and it uses `is_post_type_supported()` instead of `is_post_type_disabled()` to do so.
			* `create_canonical_url()` and `get_canonical_url()` can now fetch custom canonical URLs for terms; this is implied via trickling down methods.
			* `create_canonical_url()` now fixes input args preemptively to be in line with other getters. So you could enter an integer, although you shouldn't.
			* `get_post_type_archive_canonical_url()`
				1. Now only accepts strings or null as the first parameter.
				1. Forwarded post type object calling to WordPress' URL function.
			* `_save_inpost_primary_term()` now works as intended; and it no longer accidentally falls back on the other post meta handlers.
			* `get_separator_list()` no longer returns the `dash` index.
			* `get_home_title_seplocation()` return value, left is now right, and vice versa.
				* In extent, `get_title_seplocation( true )` also yields this behavior.
			* `s_twitter_name()` now returns empty on lone `@` entries.
			* `s_facebook_profile()` No longer returns a plain Facebook URL when the entry path is sanitized to become empty.
			* `s_relative_url()` no longer trims the prepending `/`.
			* `s_redirect_url()`
				1. No longer lets through double-absolute URLs (e.g. `https://google.com/https://google.com/path/to/file/`) when filter `the_seo_framework_allow_external_redirect` is set to false.
					* This isn't a security issue, `do_redirect()` always prepended the local host for sanity.
				1. Now tests URL schemes case-insensitive.
			* `has_robots_txt()`, now tries to load `wp-admin/includes/file.php` to prevent a fatal error.
			* `has_sitemap_xml()`, now tries to load `wp-admin/includes/file.php` to prevent a fatal error.
			* `is_term_meta_capable()` no longer incorrectly determines post type archives as capable; they aren't considered term taxonomies, because they don't yield taxonomies, but solely post types.
			* `is_category_admin()`
				1. Removed caching.
			* `is_page()`
				1. Now tests for hierarchical post types, which is more reliable.
			* `is_single()`
				1. Now tests for nonhierarchical post types, which is more reliable.
			* `is_singular()`
				1. No longer processes integers as input.
			* `is_singular_admin()`
				1. Removed first parameter.
			* `is_tag_admin()`
				1. Removed caching.
			* `is_wc_product()`
				1. Added admin support.
				1. Added a parameter for the Post ID or post to test.
			* `delete_object_cache()` now actually does something: flushes the object cache.
			* `get_available_twitter_cards()`
				1. Now only asserts the social titles as required.
				1. Now always returns an array, instead of a boolean (false) on failure.
			* `nav_tab_wrapper()`
				1. Deprecated third parameter, silently.

				* `get_sitemap_urlset_open_tag()`, we now output it directly.
				* `get_sitemap_urlset_close_tag()`, we now output it directly.

* **Property notes:**
	* For object `the_seo_framework()`:
		* **Removed:**
			* `profile_settings`
			* `page_defaults`
* **Constant notes:**
	* **Namespace `\The_SEO_Framework\`:**
		* `ROBOTS_IGNORE_PROTECTION`, used for the `the_seo_framework()->robots_meta()` method family, ignores post's password/privacy settings.
		* `ROBOTS_IGNORE_SETTINGS`, used for the `the_seo_framework()->robots_meta()` method family, ignores current post/term's SEO settings.
* **Action notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_header`, runs in the sitemap HTTP header.
		* `the_seo_framework_setting_notices`, runs below the settings header.
* **WordPress hook notes:**
	* TODO maybe? List all WP API callback changes: removal, added, changed. Good luck with the backtrace...
* **Filter notes:**
	* **Added:**
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_path_prefix`, string.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_endpoint_list`, array.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_supported_post_types`, array.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_hpt_query_args`, array.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_chpt_query_args`, array.
	* **Improved:**
		* `the_seo_framework_robots_meta_array`, now has two new parameters, `$args` and `$ignore`.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_post_limit`, now has a new parameter, `$hierarchical`.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_additional_urls`, now has a new parameter: `$args`.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_extend`, now has a new parameter: `$args`.
		* `the_seo_framework_term_meta_defaults`, now has a new parameter: `$term_id`.
	* **Changed:**
		* `the_seo_framework_scripts`:
			1. Now contains all registered scripts.
			1. Now has a new parameter: `$bridge`.
		* `the_seo_framework_term_meta_defaults` now holds more values in the first parameter.
		* `the_seo_framework_separator_list` no longer yields the `dash` index.
		* `the_seo_framework_{$type}_settings_tabs`, the callback indexes have been changed for these filters, as the class structure changed:
			* `the_seo_framework_inpost_settings_tabs`
			* `the_seo_framework_general_settings_tabs`
			* `the_seo_framework_homepage_settings_tabs`
			* `the_seo_framework_robots_settings_tabs`
			* `the_seo_framework_schema_settings_tabs`
			* `the_seo_framework_sitemaps_settings_tabs`
			* `the_seo_framework_social_settings_tabs`
			* `the_seo_framework_title_settings_tabs`
		* `the_seo_framework_inpost_settings_tabs`, the second parameter is deprecated, and henceforth yields `null`.
	* **Fixed:**
		* `the_seo_framework_title_from_generation`, now works for:
			1. the homepage title in the admin screens.
			1. the homepage title example in the admin screens.
			1. the latest post title example in the admin screens.
			1. singular breadcrumb generation.
			1. blog page's automated description.
		* `the_seo_framework_title_from_custom_field`, now works for:
			1. the homepage title example in the admin screens.
			1. all breadcrumb generation.
			1. term title placeholders.
		* `the_seo_framework_use_title_branding` now works for the homepage title in the admin screens.
		* `the_seo_framework_title_separator` now works in the admin screens.
	* **Deprecated:**
		* `the_seo_framework_save_custom_fields`, use `the_seo_framework_save_post_meta` instead. Same syntax, same effect, better name.
		* `the_seo_framework_current_term_meta`, use `get_term_metadata` instead. See WordPress function `get_metadata()` for details.
			* We know, the `get_term_metadata` filter is inconvenient, but so is maintaining and explaining the filter we deprecated.
			* This filter was largely only in place because we didn't have bulk-editing systems in place. But, now we do.
			* Moreover, there are many more hooks through which you can influence this, like when updating the term meta. Those hooks are vastly more reliable, because the term meta may be obtained elsewhere, without using our API.
	* **Removed:**
		* `the_seo_framework_js_l10n`, overhauled.
		* `the_seo_framework_get_term_meta`, this was deprecated since 3.1.0.
			* Use `the_seo_framework_term_meta_defaults` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_show_seo_column`, this is unreliable. Use the options API instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_custom_post_type_support`, this is unreliable. Use the options API instead or `the_seo_framework_supported_post_type`.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_pages_count`, use the options API or `the_seo_framework_sitemap_post_limit` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_posts_count`, use the options API or `the_seo_framework_sitemap_post_limit` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_custom_posts_count`, use the options API or `the_seo_framework_sitemap_post_limit` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_exclude_cpt`, use `the_seo_framework_sitemap_supported_post_types` instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_pages_query_args`.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_posts_query_args`.
		* `the_seo_framework_sitemap_cpt_query_args`.
		* `the_seo_framework_admin_page_defaults`, we trust our defaults are right.
		* `the_seo_framework_metabox_id`, this never worked reliably.
		* `the_seo_framework_allow_states`, use the action handler instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_ogimage_output`, use the new image generator, instead.
		* `the_seo_framework_twitterimage_output`, use the new image generator, instead.
* **Rewrite notes:**
	* **Removed:**
		* All WordPress rewrite manipulation.
	* **Changed:**
		* The following query variables have changed, in format: `from -> to`
			* `the_seo_framework_sitemap=xml -> tsf-sitemap=base`
			* `the_seo_framework_sitemap=xsl -> tsf-sitemap=xsl-stylesheet`
			* **Note:** Since these endpoints are interpreted outside of the WordPress rewrite system, these endpoints may no longer work based on your permalink settings.
* **Compatibility notes:**
	* **Unloaded:**
		* The mbstring compat file (`/inc/compat/php-mbstring.php`) is no longer loaded automatically, because we no longer need the compatibility function `mb_strpos`.
* **Browser notes:**
	* We've now officially abandoned support for Internet Explorer. Goodbye, old, annoying friend.
		* To enhance support for other deprecated browsers along the way, we now use a body class we control: `tsf-js` and `tsf-no-js`. Now, this body class changes from `tsf-no-js` to `tsf-js` only when the browser supports ES2015.
		* TODO clean up polyfills & fixes related to IE. (Done?)
	* With our most excellent users moving to HTTP/2 and beyond, we're going to take full advantage of multiplexing by sending out more scripting files.
		* More files is good, because we can selectively send out the files; so there's less code to parse in your browser on most requests.
		* This also alleviates some strain on your server, as we don't have to blindly fill states and values for all requests every time.
		* And, most importantly, maintaining the code will be much easier; so, we can deploy faster with fewer errors.
		* Last but not least, WordPress is moving from plain HTML and PHP to JS. We need to get ourselves well prepared for this shift.
		* TODO clean up RTL scripts? It's redundant having a change for only one CSS rule; offload it to `.rtl ...` (which is slower...)?
		* Affected files, both `.css` and `.js` (and their `*.min.*` equivalents):
			* `ays` - meaning "Are you sure?", these files handle on-navigation alerts, so to prevent loss of data.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfAys` and `window.tsfAysL10n`
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-ays`
			* `post`, these files handle post SEO settings pages, mostly.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfPost` and `window.tsfPostL10n`.
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-post`
			* `term`, these files handle term SEO settings pages, mostly.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfTerm` and `window.tsfTermL10n`.
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-term`
			* `tsf`, these main files are now trimmed down to the most basic of forms per dependency requirements.
				* **JS:**
					* **Before:** 27.7KB minified, 2782 SLOC
					* **After:** 2.4KB minified, (TODO TBD) 488 SLOC
				* **CSS:**
					* **Before:** 16.0KB minified, 1006 SLOC
					* **After:** 6.15KB minfified, (TODO TBD) 427 SLOC
			* `tsfc`, these files handle the character and pixel counters.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfC` and `window.tsfCL10n`.
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-c`
				* Fun fact: The proposed name was `counter.js`, but uBlock blocks this script name by default.
				* Note that this file is loaded conditionally, based on the user's settings.
			* `settings`, these files handle the SEO Settings page, mostly.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfSettings` and `window.tsfSettingsL10n`.
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-settings`
			* TODO (PROPOSED):
				* `seo-bar`, this file handles the SEO Bar.
				* `quick-edit`, this file handles quick edits.
				* `ajax`, this file handles communication with the server.
			* TODO consider moving this to a relay method, which switches over all known scripts, cleaning up the code.
				* Also remove the newly introduced methods, and use a single handler method `tsf->load_script( 'tsfc', $autoload );`
				* Also silently deprecate the 3.1 methods, and forward the calls to the one above? TODO is this already done?
		* Affected files, only `.js` (and their `*.min.*` equivalents):
			* `description`, these files handle meta description inputs.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfDescription` and `window.tsfDescriptionL10n`.
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-description`
			* `le` - meaning "List Edit", these files handle list edit page actions.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfLe` and `window.tsfLeL10n`
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-le`
				* TODO may this gets CSS?
			* `title`, these files handle meta title inputs.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfTitle` and `window.tsfTitleL10n`.
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-title`
			* `social`, these files handle social meta inputs.
				* **Namespaces:** `window.tsfSocial` and `window.tsfSocialL10n`.
				* **Script ID:** `tsf-social`

= 3.2.4 =

In this minor update, we bring you the most advanced description generation yet. The generator is now context-sensitive, so you can expect the descriptions to be even more natural; a real time-saver!

Oh, we also [fixed some bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3130), and we've implemented some improvements in preparation for version 3.3.0.

= 3.2.3 =

This minor update fixes some old, [leftover bugs](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3105). We've also removed the sitemap pinging options for Yandex, as they no longer allow this.

= 3.2.2 =

This minor update brings [major bug fixes](https://theseoframework.com/?p=3022). Most notoriously, the homepage settings now predict the metadata perfectly in the admin screens. Bloggers will love this update, too, because Facebook and Twitter metadata for the home blog page is now always correct.

For developers, please note that the upcoming major release (3.3.0) will introduce new taxonomical settings. Because the image-rendering integration isn't suited for this, it'll be overhauled. For more information, see [this issue](https://github.com/sybrew/the-seo-framework/issues/403).

Also, for developers, note that some API changes better suited for a major release were also brought into this minor release; these were required to fix some bugs.

= 3.2.1 =

This minor update [fixes script load-order issues](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2982) which can occur when other plugins try to interact with the new WordPress editor.

= 3.2.0 - Horizon =

*What is right to be done cannot be done too soon. - Jane Austen*

**Release date**

* December 4th, 2018

**Release highlights**

* A new editor (codename Gutenberg) will launch [in just two days](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/04/new-5-0-target-date/) with WordPress 5.0. This release makes the plugin fully compatible with it.
* Description prefixes have been removed. Descriptions aren't used a ranking factor anymore, and gaming the system by repeating the title isn't beneficial.

**Did you know?**

* We recently relaunched a plugin for The SEO Framework. [Learn more](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2760).

**Detailed log**

Happy Holidays! [(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻┻](https://theseoframework.com/?p=2957)

== Upgrade Notice ==
